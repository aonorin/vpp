- better renderer resetting (all command pools at once, just resize the frameRenderers vector)
- textures (overthing viewable image + sampler)
- fully implement examples!
	- general initializer
		- something about descriptors and descriptor pools
		- think about buffer/image providers (better not)
	- improve classes to use allocators and provider
	- backend agnostic createContext function
	- display class for vkDisplayKHR extension
	- queue management
		- easier querying/creation/using for commands
	- some smaller improvements
		- mapMemory: check valid usage (esp. alignment and stuff)
		- pmr for performance critical (every-frame) functions.
