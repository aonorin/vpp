//Let vpp query the backend and create a context for it.
//Normally you would pass some createInfo as 2nd param wich describes e.g. which
//queues/extensions/layers and
//debug information you want, we just use the defaults here.
//In this case we e.g. create a win32 context by using the win32 createContext overload.

//Context is basically just a all-in-one wrapper for the objects needed to render with vulkan
//If you want fine-grained control over these objects, the Context class is not what you want.

//build your render command buffers, but manages all the rest for you.
