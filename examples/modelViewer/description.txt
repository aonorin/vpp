- Just one rendering pipeline for meshes
- Every Material has its own ubo and textures
- Mesh is defined as a set of vertices with the same material
- Every Mesh has its own descriptorSet
	- ubo holding the combined transform matrix [mesh buffer]
	- ubo holding the material data [material buffer]
	- ubo holding the scene data [scene buffer]
	- bunch of textures (diffuseMap) [material textures]
