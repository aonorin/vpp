- Just one rendering pipeline for meshes
- Every Material has its own ubo and textures
- Mesh is defined as a set of vertices with the same material
- Every Mesh has its own descriptorSet
	- ubo holding the combined transform matrix [mesh buffer]
	- ubo holding the material data [material buffer]
	- ubo holding the scene data [scene buffer]
	- bunch of textures (diffuseMap) [material textures]

offscreen pipeline:
	- set 0
		- binding 0: scene data (only shadow matrix needed)

render pipeline:
	- set 0
		- binding 0: model transform matrix
		- binding 1: scene data (lights, shadow matrix)
		- binding 2: material data (only fragment, color/fac values)
		- binding 3: diffuse map
		- binding 4: shadow map

shadow map image layout:
	- starts with undefined
	- when rendering offscreen: depthStencilAttachmentOptimal
	- when reading: shaderReadOnlyOptimal
